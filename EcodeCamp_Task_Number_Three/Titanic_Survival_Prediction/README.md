# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview
The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model to assess the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the Titanic. Utilizing data from the Titanic dataset available on Kaggle, this project encompasses exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, machine learning model training, and deployment through a user-friendly Streamlit application.

## Objectives
- **Predictive Modeling**: To create a model that predicts whether a passenger survived based on various attributes.
- **Data Exploration**: To explore and visualize the dataset to identify significant factors influencing survival rates.
- **Data Preprocessing**: To clean and prepare the dataset for machine learning, ensuring it is suitable for training.

## Project Structure
The project follows a well-organized folder structure to maintain clarity and manageability:

## Implementation Details

### Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The first notebook, `01_EDA.ipynb`, includes:
- **Data Loading**: Importing the Titanic dataset.
- **Initial Insights**: Displaying the first few rows and data types.
- **Missing Values Handling**: Filling missing values in the `Age` and `Embarked` columns.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating a new feature, `FamilySize`, by combining siblings/spouses and parents/children aboard.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizing the survival count and encoding categorical variables to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- **Data Saving**: Exporting the cleaned data to `cleaned_data.csv` for further analysis.

### Step 2: Model Training
The second notebook, `02_Model_Training.ipynb`, includes:
- **Data Loading**: Loading the cleaned dataset.
- **Feature Selection**: Splitting data into features and target variable.
- **Model Training**: Training various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- **Model Evaluation**: Comparing model accuracies and saving the best-performing model (Random Forest) to a Pickle file for future use.

### Step 3: Streamlit App
The `streamlit_app.py` file provides:
- A user-friendly interface where users can input passenger details to predict survival.
- Preprocessing of input data to match the format used during model training.
- Display of prediction results based on user input.

### Step 4: Dependencies
A `requirements.txt` file is included to manage the necessary dependencies for the project, including libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Streamlit.

### Step 5: Running the Application
To run the Streamlit app, execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## Conclusion
This project showcases the end-to-end process of building a predictive model, from data collection and preprocessing to model evaluation and deployment. The insights gained from the EDA and the performance of the trained model highlight the importance of data-driven decision-making in understanding historical events such as the Titanic disaster.

Feel free to explore the code, run the application, and analyze how different features influence survival on the Titanic!
