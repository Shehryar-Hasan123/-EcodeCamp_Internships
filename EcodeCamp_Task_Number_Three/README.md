# EDA on Titanic Survival Predictions

## Purpose

The "EDA on Titanic Survival Predictions" project aims to develop a predictive model that can determine the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the Titanic. By leveraging the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, this project seeks to analyze historical data, uncover patterns, and build a model that can provide insights into the factors influencing survival rates.

This project serves several educational and practical purposes:

1. **Data Exploration and Analysis**: It involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics, identify trends, and visualize the data. This foundational analysis helps to derive meaningful insights and understand the context behind the data.

2. **Predictive Modeling**: By implementing various machine learning algorithms (including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest), this project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate predictive models. It showcases the process of model selection based on performance metrics.

3. **Real-World Application**: The project simulates a real-world scenario of predicting survival based on various features such as age, sex, class, and more. It provides an understanding of how data science can be applied to historical events to derive actionable insights.

4. **Skill Development**: This project offers hands-on experience with critical data science concepts, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation. It enhances skills in Python programming, data manipulation with Pandas, and machine learning with Scikit-learn.

5. **Deployment**: Finally, the project also includes deploying the model using a web framework, allowing users to input passenger details and receive predictions. This aspect of the project demonstrates how machine learning models can be integrated into user-friendly applications.

Overall, this project not only contributes to the understanding of survival rates on the Titanic but also serves as a comprehensive example of the data science workflow from data collection to model deployment.
