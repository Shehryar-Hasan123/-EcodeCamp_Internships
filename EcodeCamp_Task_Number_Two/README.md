# Real-Time Stock Price Prediction System

## Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a real-time stock price prediction system using historical stock data. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, this system aims to provide accurate predictions of stock prices based on historical trends.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: 
  - Utilize financial APIs, specifically Polygon.io and Yahoo Finance, to collect stock data for various symbols, including cryptocurrencies.
  - Preprocess the collected data through feature engineering and scaling for improved model performance.

- **Model Building**:
  - Train a time-series forecasting model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) to predict future stock prices.
  - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

- **Real-Time Implementation**:
  - Deploy the trained model using a web framework (Streamlit) for easy access and interaction.
  - Create an intuitive user interface to display real-time stock predictions and historical data.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical computations
  - `matplotlib` for data visualization
  - `sklearn` for preprocessing and model evaluation
  - `keras` for building the LSTM model
  - `yfinance` and `requests` for data retrieval from financial APIs
  - `streamlit` for deploying the web application

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
1. Run the data collection script to fetch stock data and train the model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
2. Start the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
3. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Code Explanation
- The code includes functions to fetch stock data from both Polygon.io and Yahoo Finance. It handles different stock symbols and performs data preprocessing.
- The LSTM model is constructed using the Keras library, with appropriate layers and configurations to improve the prediction accuracy.
- The model is trained on historical data, and predictions are visualized using Matplotlib. The Streamlit app provides an interactive interface for users to enter stock symbols and view predictions.

## Future Improvements
- Implement additional features such as news sentiment analysis to enhance predictions.
- Expand the dataset to include more stocks and cryptocurrencies for broader market analysis.
- Optimize the model architecture and hyperparameters for better performance.
